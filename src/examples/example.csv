1*A 65-year-old male presents with a history of severe, abdominal bloating and bilious vomiting for the past 12 hours. On examination, he has diffuse abdominal tenderness. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg, heart rate of 120 bpm, and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. The patient's venous blood gas (VBG) shows: pH 7.25 (7.35-7.45), PCO2 30 mmHg (35-45 mmHg), PO2 70 mmHg (75-100 mmHg), and lactate 6 mmol/L.*What is the most likely diagnosis?*['A. Appendicitis','B. Diverticulitis','C. Gastroenteritis','D. Intestinal Obstruction','E. Perforated Sigmoid Volvulus']*4*['A. Appendicitis is incorrect. Appendicitis typically presents with localized right lower quadrant pain and lack the systemic and diagnostic features seen in this case. Progressive abdominal discomfort with high lactate suggests ischaemia or perforation.','B. Diverticulitis is incorrect. Diverticulitis involves inflammation of diverticula without the significant systemic upset and high lactate seen here. Such severe symptoms and VBG findings suggest a more catastrophic event. Additionally, there would classically be other indication like left lower palpable abdominal masses (indicating impacted stool).','C. Gastroenteritis is incorrect. Gastroenteritis generally presents with diarrhoea, mild to moderate dehydration, and lacks the severe systemic manifestations and abnormal VBG indicative of bowel perforation and ischaemia.','D. Intestinal Obstruction is incorrect. While intestinal obstruction can produce pain and vomiting, it usually does not produce the marked lactic acidosis and potential signs of sepsis seen here.','E. Perforated Sigmoid Volvulus is the correct answer. The combination of acute, diffuse abdominal pain, bilious vomiting, significant tenderness, and markedly raised lactate on VBG is indicative of bowel perforation and ischaemia, consistent with a perforated sigmoid volvulus. This is further supported by the patient's hemodynamic instability. Immediate surgical intervention is required.']*Acute and Emergeny*['Abdominal distension','Abdominal mass','Acute abdominal pain','Change in bowel habit Vomiting']
2*A 70-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease and a previous laparotomy presents with acute, severe epigastric pain and bilious vomiting. He has a distended abdomen with tenderness on palpation. His vital signs are blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, heart rate 115 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and temperature 37.2Â°C. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count at 14 x10^9/L, with an abdominal X-ray showing coffee bean sign with two air-fluid levels.*Which combination of risk factors likely contributed the most to this patient's current condition?*['A. Chronic laxative use and Low fiber diet','B. Parkinson's disease and Previous laparotomy','C. Previous gastroenteritis and Regular laxative use','D. Parkinson's disease and Low fiber diet','E. Previous C.diff infection and Severe constipation']*1*['A. Chronic laxative use and Low fiber diet are not recognized risk factors for gastric volvulus. These factors are generally associated with motility issues and constipation rather than the anatomical distortions necessary for volvulus formation.','B. Parkinson's disease and Previous laparotomy are correct. Impaired gastrointestinal motility in Parkinson's disease can lead to slower transit times and increased risk of volvulus due to autonomic dysfunction. Additionally, previous laparotomy can result in adhesions that predispose the stomach to twist, causing volvulus.','C. Previous gastroenteritis and Regular laxative use are not risk factors for gastric volvulus. Gastroenteritis is typically associated with temporary inflammation, and regular laxative use is linked to bowel motility issues rather than anatomical changes.','D. Parkinson's disease and Low fiber diet include one correct and one incorrect risk factor. Parkinson's disease contributes to gastric volvulus due to impaired gastrointestinal motility, but a low fiber diet is not a risk factor for this condition.','E. Severe constipation can cause discomfort and the sigmoid colon can overloaded with faeces, causing it to sink downwards causing a twist. However, previous C.diff infection has not been shown to predispose a patient to volvulus.']*Acute and Emergency*['Abdominal distension','Abdominal mass','Acute abdominal pain','Change in bowel habit Vomiting']
